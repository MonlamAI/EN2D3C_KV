A Lotus of Twofold Purpose: A Very Concise Aspiration Prayer for the Nine Vehicles Oṃ svasti siddhaṃ! I bow to the buddhas and bodhisattvas, who have the wondrous youthful beauty of the major and minor marks, Embodying the qualities of renunciation and realization; I bow to their speech, the sublime Dharma; And I bow to whichever saṅgha communities uphold that Dharma! Seekers of individual liberation restrain the mind stream with the discipline of carefulness. Pratyekabuddhas take as the path the progression and reverse order of dependent origination. Bodhisattvas are concerned with selflessness and the welfare of others. May my being be liberated by the approaches that lead away from the origin of suffering. In Kriyātantra, one views oneself as lower and the deity as exalted. In Caryātantra, they are not different, in the manner of friends. In Yogatantra, both arise as wisdom deities. May I take as the path the approaches that evoke awareness through ascetic practices. Mahāyoga realizes the environment and its inhabitants as the three maṇḍalas. The path of Anuyoga is empty bliss, the unity of timeless wisdom and basic space. In the luminous Great Perfection, original purity is naturally free. May I accomplish the ultimate path through the vehicles of skillful means. Thus, by engaging or not engaging with impure appearances On the profound and secret path of the kāyas and wisdoms, May I understand all the divisions of the causal and resultant vehicles And their philosophies completely and distinctly. May the Three Jewels, the Three Roots, the three kāyas, and the deities of the maṇḍala In this way help to fully accomplish The power of my aspirations for the sake of others, And may the glory of magnificent benefits and happiness be attained! The magical display of Zhönu Jigme Yeshe Dorje immediately expressed whatever came to mind. Sarva maṅgalaṃ.
